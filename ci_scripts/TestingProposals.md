# Testing Proposals

---

**1.  Tests in  development environment and automated tests**

dev-environment: 
 - very simplistic but allows fast refresh-restart
 - it could be 2-3 nodes  in one-two networks 
 - easily integrated with IDEs, etc
 - allows manual intervention

and test-environment: it could be tens (and more) nodes with complex network topologies, different switches between them, different speeds ... ( I'm speekin from my memory with another SDN-project)
and we don't have requirements for test-environment yet
 - mostly automated

**2. "Blackbox"-"Whitebox"-other "boxes"**


"blackbox - whitebox" -  I mean:
- "blackbox" - you know nothing about internals
-  "whitebox" - you know internals and work accordingly

"grey" - is somewhere between them



**3. Travis-CI**



**4. Fuzzy-testing. go-fuzz**


**5. Non-CI tests**
